## Design

An ESP8266 connects to a MQTT server and waits for commands. It also runs a web
server serving a MQTT client web UI ([try it
online!](https://maruel.ca/bolide-esp8266/?host=127.0.0.1&port=9001&device=bolide))
that you can install as an App on your iOS or Android phone or tablet.

`bolide-esp8266` uses the [Homie MQTT
convention](https://github.com/homieiot/convention/blob/develop/convention.md)
so you can control it via any MQTT enabled automation service like
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [openHAB](http://openhab.org),
or internet based services like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), if you really feel
the urge to connect stuff to the internet. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯


## Hardware

- [Car kit](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=robot+4wd)
  (20$USD) including motors but the ones with an Arduino Uno is unnecessary.
  You may buy one with a power converter and/or batteries and/or batteries
  holders already included.
- [WeMos D1 mini](https://wemoscc.aliexpress.com/store/1331105) (4$USD) or any
  ESP8266 based board. One with a micro USB port is recommended.
- [L293D](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=l293d+dip&SortType=price_asc)
  quadruple half-H driver (1.75$USD for 5pcs). Buy more than one, just in case
  you bend a pin.
- [Passive
  buzzer](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=passive+buzzer&SortType=price_asc)
  (0.50$USD) because it's more annoying when it beeps and we love annoying toys;
  optional.
- [LEDs](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=200pcs+led+box&SortType=price_asc)
  (3$USD for 200pcs) for additional feedback; optional.
- [Resistor
  ~300Ohms](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-metal-film.html?SearchText=metal+film&SortType=price_asc&CatId=400503)
  for the LED (0.58$USD for 100pcs; 2.37$USD for 500pcs); optional.
- [400 points
  Breadboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=breadboard+400&SortType=price_asc)
  (1$USD) or [2x
  SYD-170](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=syb-170) (0.38$USD
  each).
- [Breadboard
  wires](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=140+breadboard+wires&SortType=price_asc)
  (1.75$USD) or whatever wire you have around.
- [Screen terminal
  block](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=Screw+Terminal+Block)
  (0.80USD for 10pcs).
- [Tactile
  button switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=tactile+button)
  (2$USD for 100pcs, depends on size).
- Computer to run Mosquitto; a Raspberry Pi or your workstation will do just
  fine.


**BOM:** 36$USD, _including shipping_, with a lot of left overs.


### Power âš¡

The system runs at 2 or 3 different voltages:

- The ESP8266 needs 3.3V and will burn if exposed at >=4V.
  - The WeMos D1 Mini already includes a 5V -> 3.3V DC-DC converter, which
    simplifies our life. If you use an ESP8266 which doesn't include this, you
    have to plan accordingly.
- The L293D needs 4.5V~7V for its internal logic to operate.
- The motors need 5V~12V. *Higher voltage means a faster race car*.

There's three options for motor voltage:

1. Power the motors at 5V. It will move *slowly* but you can upgrade later.
2. Use a [DC-DC step down power converter
   (>=1A)](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=dc-dc) (1$USD; 2$USD
   for 5pcs) and run the motors at high voltage then generate a 5V from it. You
   may want/need to add a capacitor accross the lines to stabilize the voltage.
3. Use two different power sources, one 5V, one >5V. This has the side benefit
   of making voltage for the ESP8266 to be more stable.

There's _many_ options for power sources:

1. Wired [5V~12V
   wallwart](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=9v+2a+adapter)
   (3$USD) and [female
   adaptor](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=5.5mm+female+dc)
   (0.50$USD).
   - You may have one lying around from an old dead electronic device!
2. AA batteries; 4x 1.5V (Alkaline) gives 6V, 6x 1.2V (Eneloop) gives 7.2V. AAA
   are likely not able to push enough Amps.
3. [5V USB power
   bank](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=usb+power+bank&SortType=price_asc)
   (<2$USD). Even the cheapest colored round ones will be fine as the ESP8266
   draws around 100mA. The cheapest ones **won't** be enough for the motor but
   high qualities ones (the ones rated for 2A) will be fine.
4. 2x 3.7V LiPo batteries to give 7.4V:
  - [7.4V LiPo battery
    (>=1000mAh)](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=7.4v+battery+mAh&SortType=price_asc)
    (10$USD).
  - [2x Soshine 18650
    >=2600mAh](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=soshine+18650+battery)
    (15$USD for 2pcs).
  - [2x Soshine 14500 (AA format;
    >=800mAh)](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=Soshine+14500+battery)
    (20$USD for 4pcs) batteries; the main advantage is these fit AA cases.
5. [2x 3.2V LiFePo4](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=lifepo4)
   batteries to give 6V:
  - Similar to LiPo batteries, but [not suspectible to
    explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery#Safety).
    The 6V level is too high to power the WeMos without burning the
    [RT9013](http://www.richtek.com/assets/product_file/RT9013/DS9013-10.pdf)
    voltage regulator. They are available in both 14500 (AA format) and 18650, I
    recommend branded batteries.
  - I wouldn't be surprised if we see cellphones with LiFePo4 batteries in 2017.
    I said it here first! :)


#### Confused? ðŸ˜•

Keep it simple and start with a **USB power bank** to power the WeMos and **4x
AA Alkaline batteries** to power the motors.


#### Be aware

- Aliexpress searches are really hit-and-miss, it's possible it just decides
  to show you unrelated items depending on how it feels.
- mAh values are generally **overstated** by the seller.
- Shipping LiPo batteries cost more, so it may be simpler to source it locally.
- *You need a charger*.


## Wiring

Use the breadboard and the breadboard wires to connect everything:

[![Wiring schematics](https://github.com/maruel/bolide-esp8266/raw/master/resources/schematics.png)](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=240df0897d66470eb822c16866b1031e)

### Permanent soldering

Once you confirmed it to work, you may want to solder the L293D to reduce the
overall size:

- Generic
  [Stripboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=Stripboard+Veroboard)
  (varies) or the [WeMos
  protoboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/ProtoBoard-Shield-for-WeMos-D1-mini-double-sided-perf-board/1331105_32627711647.html)
  (1$USD).
  - The WeMos one is interesting because it is small and fits perfectly the D1
    mini.
- [Adjustable soldering
  Iron](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=soldering+iron+adjustable)
  (10$USD).
- [Multicore 63/37 26AWG 227g
  spool](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/multicore/397982/82-131-ND/2498929)
  (21$USD). Trust me, don't cheap out and do not buy one from Aliexpress!
  - âš  Lead may reduce your life expectancy but it was well worth it.


## Software Installation

### Install mosquitto

1. On Ubuntu 16.04+ or Debian Jessie, run: `sudo apt install mosquitto`. On
   other OSes get it from https://mosquitto.org/download.
2. Run the following to enable Websocket on port 9001 (adapt for other OSes):

```
cat << 'EOF' | sudo tee /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/ws.conf
listener 1883
listener 9001
protocol websockets
EOF
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
```

**âš :** anyone on the local network and see and inject commands.


### Install [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org)

#### GUI

1. Install [Atom](https://atom.io).
2. Open Atom. In _Settings_, _Install_, type _platformio_ in the box and choose
   _platformio-ide_.
3. Click 'Rebuild' on the little box on the very bottom right.

##### CLI

Run `pip install --user --upgrade platformio`


## Flashing

1. Connect an ESP8266 via USB.
2. (optional) Copy `config_sample.json` to `data/homie/config.json` and [edit as
   documented](https://homieiot.github.io/homie-esp8266/docs/2.0.0/configuration/json-configuration-file/):
   - device name and id
   - Wifi SSID and password
   - MQTT server host name, port, user and password
   - This is not required, as you can do it manually via the web UI as explained
     below.
3. Run: `./flash_all.sh` at a bash prompt.

The ESP8266 takes less than a second to boot.


## Manual device configuration

If `data/homie/config.json` settings didn't work out, the blue LED will be solid
blue as the ESP8266 will boot in configuration mode. Configure it manually with
the web UI:

1. Connect to the Wifi `bolide-xxx`. The password is the `xxx` portion of the
   SSID.
2. Open a Web browser and navigate to http://192.168.123.1.
3. Follow the instructions.
   - Configure the wifi to use
   - Configure the MQTT server to use
   - Use a friendly name like "Bolide" and a device name like "bolide".
   - Enable OTA.
4. At this point the LED will go slow blink, rapid blink then will turn off.
